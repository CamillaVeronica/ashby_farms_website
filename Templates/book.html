				<p>The rental charges above are a guide. If your stay spans more than one charging period the rate is calculated to reflect the proportion of each period, from this the monthly rental is derived for the length of your expected stay. Should you decide
				to leave earlier than you originally planned (at least two weeks notice is required) the rate is recalculated to reflect your
				actual length of stay and any difference is adjusted via in your returned security deposit should there be any further
				money outstanding it will be invoiced to you. This flexibility is particularly appreciated by people who are between
				house moves.</p>
